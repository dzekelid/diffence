      summary: Get Repositories Username Repo Slug Diff Spec
      description: |-
        Produces a raw, git-style diff for either a single commit (diffed
        against its first parent), or a revspec of 2 commits (e.g.
        `3a8b42..9ff173` where the first commit represents the source and the
        second commit the destination).

        In case of the latter (diffing a revspec), a 3-way diff, or merge diff,
        is computed. This shows the changes introduced by the left branch
        (`3a8b42` in our example) as compared againt the right branch
        (`9ff173`).

        This is equivalent to merging the left branch into the right branch and
        then computing the diff of the merge commit against its first parent
        (the right branch). This follows the same behavior as pull requests
        that also show this style of 3-way, or merge diff.

        While similar to patches, diffs:

        * Don't have a commit header (username, commit message, etc)
        * Support the optional `path=foo/bar.py` query param to filter
          the diff to just that one file diff

        The raw diff is returned as-is, in whatever encoding the files in the
        repository use. It is not decoded into unicode. As such, the
        content-type is `text/plain`.
